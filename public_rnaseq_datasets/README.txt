===> This folder contains scripts and metadata for the re-analysis of public bulk and single cell RNA-seq datasets <===

=> scripts
Scripts are stored in dataset-specific subfolders. 
feature_metadata contains a script to produce gene_metadata.csv and transcript_metadata.csv for the analysis of LCM-seq and human scRNA-seq datasets.
Modify the "Define paths" section of the scripts before execution.

=> data
Metadata is stored in dataset-specific subfolders.
The provided metadata was derived from the original publications or from public databases hosting the corresponding sequencing data.
It is mainly used in the scripts to produced sample_metadata.csv.

=============================

Raw / processed sequencing data:
A link to access publicly available sequencing data is systematically included in the "Define paths" section of the scripts.

Salmon's quant.sf files:
LCM-seq dataset: can be shared upon request.
FOUNDIN-PD dataset: should be retrieved from the Parkinsonâ€™s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI).
